	I have tried creating a library funtion which is similar to in-built library function "string.h" along with some extra functions. The string function works in a similar manner and produces appropriate output as that of standard in-built library function. The extra functions are kind of basic maths funtions like sine, cosine, tangent, sqaure root and power. The input variable and the function done by the respective code is briefly given as comments in the "stringheader.h" file. The main function is not that appropriate, was just written to test all the funtions..!!
